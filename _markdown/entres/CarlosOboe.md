# CarlosOboe.com

This website was created for a client who, primarily, sells and repairs Oboes. The client is well known in his industry and needed a website to match. This project included the creation of a custom content management system, over 20 pages of unique content, and many other custom features. A strong emphasis was placed on clean and refined, minimal design. 

The site was built with a LAMP stack from the ground up with a custom, rudimentary PHP framework. A CMS system enables the owner to update the listing of their used oboes and to update upcoming appearances where their clients can meet them.

Below are several screenshots of the website. The website can be actively browsed and utilized at [carlosoboe.com](carlosoboe.com).
