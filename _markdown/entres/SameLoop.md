# SameLoop.com

This web application was created for a client who runs an automotive dealership. They needed an efficient way to communicate throughout the dealership; i.e., a way to keep everyone in the same loop.

The app was built with a LAMP stack from the ground up with a custom, rudimentary PHP framework. The software supports an arbitrary number of "content panels" which display a specific type of content. There are multiple view modes for the software: regular view, full content management, subset content management, and TV view.  

Below are several screenshots of the website. The website is active at a publicly available address but is not browsable without the required passcodes.

The regular view mode, after logging in:
![web_preview][normal_view]

An example of logging into the full content management view, from the regular view mode:
![web_preview][login_example]

The full content management view, after logging in further:
![web_preview][manager_view]

An example of adding an entry to a content panel:
![web_preview][add_entry_example]
