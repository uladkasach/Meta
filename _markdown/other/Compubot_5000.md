# Compubot 5000

Starting with the first machine learning project the necessity of having a machine that can handle large datasets in memory and conduct computations in parallel was made abundantly clear.

I found a tutorial online that listed how one may create a server from two XEON CPU's in the same computer for a "budget price supercomputer". In the end, I managed to create a computer with 16 real cores (32 logical cores) and 64 GB of RAM with the ability to double that size. Although the clockspeed of the processors is not incredible (2.4ghz) the machine has been critical in many applications already. [Here is the parts list][parts_list].

##Here are a few snippets of the beaut:
