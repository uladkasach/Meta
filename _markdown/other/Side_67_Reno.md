# Renovation of Side '67

With the long time tenant moving out due to his new marriage the half he was living in was in desperate need of some love and care. By the tenant's accounts, even before he moved in there were serious issues with the property.

The plan was to upgrade the electrics, paint all of the walls, update all of the "finishing touches" (door knobs, outlets, blinds, bathroom hardware, lights, etc...), and if time allowed to upgrade the floors.

As summer started and progressed the plan was quickly reduced in scope to simply painting and updating finishing touches. This in itself pushed the deadline to the limit. The tenant moved in as the final finishing touches were being completed. I was very fortunate that I found a tenant that was happy to move in based only on the state that the other half was in (thankfully I was able to bring that side up to a level in which it was very respectably presentable in time).

Here are a few snippets from the experience:
