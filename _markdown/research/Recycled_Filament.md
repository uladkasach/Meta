# Viability of Recycled Filaments in 3D Printing

This project was lead by [Dr. Tovar][tovar_home] funded by a [MURI grant][muri_desc].

The project was born with an initial, broad desire to assess the viability of creating and utilizing filament for 3D printers from recycled plastic. This was my first research project and was an excellent introduction into the variable dynamics and goals of conducting research.

The project consisted of a long period of literature review and definition in the goals of the research progress. Armed with a general idea that we needed to assess the viability of recycled filament in 3D printers it eventually became clear that we needed to first evaluate and the mechanical characteristics of filaments which can be successfully printed and then the evaluation of recycled filaments can be conducted.

This research is promising as a systematic way to evaluate the viability of filaments will enable a systematic approach to creating and modifying filaments to optimize their viability in 3D printing. E.g., once the characteristics of ideal filaments and recycled plastics are known, the recycled plastics can be doped and blended in order to produce viable filaments for printing.

## Pre-Print Draft

The paper for this project was never completed but a thorough summary of key pieces of the project is included in an early draft nonetheless. It is included here, tentatively titled "Printability of ABS-HDPE Blended Virgin Filaments"

## Involvement

In this project I took a significant role in narrowing and refining the scope of the project in order to define actionable research which can be conducted. The broad scope of the initial state of the research project made this a necessity.

The first two weeks of the project were relegated to intensive literature reviews in which I read and summarized over 200 papers in an attempt to define the state of the art in filament fabrication and evaluation.

The rest of the project resided in a mix of creating filaments from recycled plastics, creating testing specimens from the filament with 3D printers, and testing the specimens for their mechanical characteristics.

While we assumed that the evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of virgin plastics would be possible with 3D printed specimens we found, late into the project, that it would be more useful to first evaluate the filament itself before attempting to evaluate the structures the filament can produce. In hindsight, this is very apparent. The printing process itself creates many variables in mechanical properties that are independent of the printing material.

Problems printing the specimens from filaments created from virgin plastics were rampant. Problems included warping of the printed material, lack of adhesion to the printing table, and constant jamming due to high flexibility or high brittleness depending on which virgin material was being used. The following photos demonstrate some of these phenomena.

## Take-Aways

The research project was very formative in my development: from this the value of a thorough literature review and far thinking foresight in research planning was made abundantly clear. In addition to this, it was made thoroughly clear the value of eliminating variables and narrowing the scope of the project in order to evaluate precisely the most impact aspects of the area you are working on.  

At this point in my academic career I had only recently decided that I would like to become a PhD candidate in Machine Learning in the future. This project was the first affirmation that research was an excellent place for me. I thrived in the ability to define research questions, review the state of the art, and compose plans in how to address relevant questions.

Although a clear picture of what should be done in order to successfully research this area was not formulated until it was too late, this experience was nonetheless invaluable to my research career. Perhaps, even, it was more so valuable in the fact that it enabled me to engage in the formulation of a clear research plan first hand rather than just doing what I was told.
